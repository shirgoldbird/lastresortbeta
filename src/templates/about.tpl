<h1 id="page-title"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Welcome to the Last Resort!</span></h1>
<p>College drop-out Sophia Majorelle thinks her life is pretty much a miserable failure. She's got no plans, no hopes, no dreams, no nothing.</p>
<p>So, when an eccentric man offers her a job as a bellgirl at a hotel in the afterlife (yes, literally, the afterlife), she figures she might as well accept.</p>
<p>It's not like she's got anything better to do, right?</p>
<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="--darkreader-inline-color: #ffa31a; text-decoration: underline;">Origins...</span></span></h1>
<p>The year is 2020. All over the globe, people have been staying inside their homes for months on end, trying their best to not fall prey to a global pandemic.</p>
<p>It's two AM. Two people sit in bed, aimlessly bouncing off ideas for a project. Their names aren't important. How they look like isn't important, either (but if it was important, rest assured, they are totally good-looking and fit). The only thing that matters is that so far they've only come up with a Ghost Grandma dating sim so, clearly, things are not going well.</p>
<p>"This prompt card says a bus. What about a creepy bus that just picks you up and takes you, I don't know, somewhere?"</p>
<p>"This one says your story should have a skeleton."</p>
<p>"<em>The skeleton is driving the bus."</em></p>
<p>"Where's he taking you?"</p>
<p>"... A hotel."</p>
<p>"A hotel? Why a hotel?"</p>
<p>"Because I just thought of the title 'The Last Resort' and it sounds badass. And here's the plot: one day, this bus rolls to a stop in front of you, and Mr. Bones Dude comes out all 'hey, can you help me run this hotel' and you have nothing better to do that day, so you say sure."</p>
<p>"And then you go work at his hotel for dead people."</p>
<p>"For dead people."</p>
<p>"Like the afterlife!"</p>
<p>"...I see."</p>
<p><br /><br />That's totally how it happened.</p>
